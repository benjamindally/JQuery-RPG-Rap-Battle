RPG Rap Battle

Instructions: 

First select your character. After that, select your first opponent. If you win the battle, you may choose a second opponent. If you win against the second opponent as well, you can play the last available enemy. Beating all of the other characters results in a win.

Your attack doubles each time you battle. But the opponents attack does not double, so use this to your advantage!
